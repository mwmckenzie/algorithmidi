### Pachabel's Canon

A song everyone should be familiar with helps to highlight how the generator captures the nature of the song.

Diverges and branches just enough to present a different experience in the end.

Also gives a bit of insight into the 'endless' aspect of the song gen, as this example stretches the song to create a non-looping 15 minute playthrough.

### Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor

A very distinct organ work and unlikely candidate due to the intricate and complex nature of the song.

Regardless, the generator endlessly weaves various themes and passages of the work back and forth and into a distinct, yet familiar fugal work.

### Bach's Invention Series

Less well known, but quite distinguishable once heard.

The shortness of the songs help make it easy to note the variation in the generated versions.

The shortness also allows for easy observation of the generators 'endless' capabilities.
