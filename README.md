# Algorithmidi
Algorithmidi is an application for creating and visualising procedurally generated songs from any arbitrary midi file in real-time.

Song generation within the application currently utilises a novel <b>Micro Music Model (MMM)</b> algorithm that trains on-demand using a single midi file in only a few seconds.

&nbsp;

## The Micro Music Model (MMM)
The <b>Micro Music Model (MMM)</b> that Algorithmidi uses behind the scenes is a novel ML algorithm with an approach that is remarkably similar to modern Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The significant difference between the MMM algorithm and current LLLMs is the ability for the MMM to train on a single example song locally and in real-time. Hence the 'Micro' in MMM.

Being dependent on a single training example, the MMM output quality and the level of variation from the original song are proportional to suitability of the input midi file. 

Regardless, in almost all cases the MMM algorithm is able to find a stable and coherent trained model from which it can procedurally generate effectively infinite song variations.

## Desktop Application In Development
The Algorithmidi desktop application is currently in development.

&nbsp;

### Demo App in Testing
A demo version is currently undergoing testing with a targeted Fall 2023 release.

# Example Songs
Standout examples of well-known songs or interesting variational output

&nbsp;

### Pachabel's Canon

A song everyone should be familiar with helps to highlight how the generator captures the nature of the song.

Diverges and branches just enough to present a different experience in the end.

Also gives a bit of insight into the 'endless' aspect of the song gen, as this example stretches the song to create a 15 minute playthrough with non-repeating fractal variations.

&nbsp;

### Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor

A very distinct organ work and unlikely candidate due to the intricate and complex nature of the song.

Regardless, the generator endlessly weaves various themes and passages of the work back and forth and into a distinct, yet familiar fugal work.

When fed a piano rendition of the fugue the generator produces another unique variation that is able to fractally loop infinitely (Playback truncated for the web).

&nbsp;

### Bach's Invention Series

Less well known, but quite distinguishable once heard.

The shortness of the songs help make it easy to note the variation in the generated versions.

The shortness also allows for easy observation of the generators 'endless' capabilities.
