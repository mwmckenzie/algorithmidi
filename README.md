# **Algorithmidi: The Future of Procedural Music Generation**

&nbsp;

**Algorithmidi** revolutionizes the realm of music creation by harnessing the power of its unique Micro Music Model (MMM) algorithm. This innovative tool grants artists and enthusiasts alike the ability to generate and visualize infinite song variations from any given MIDI file, all in real-time.

Algorithmidi is not just an application; it's a musical movement. By seamlessly blending technology with the artistry of music, it paves the way for boundless creativity. Whether you're a seasoned composer or a curious listener, Algorithmidi invites you to a universe where the melodies are infinite and the possibilities are endless. Join us on this rhythmic journey and let your imagination soar!

## **The Micro Music Model (MMM) - A Game-Changer in Music Generation**

Drawing inspiration from the architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Micro Music Model (MMM) stands out with its nimbleness and agility. Unlike conventional models that require extensive training on vast datasets, the MMM thrives on a single example. By training on just one MIDI song, it can swiftly understand, interpret, and then produce myriad variations of the piece. The term 'Micro' in its name alludes to its unique capability of fast, on-the-spot training, guaranteeing users a dynamic and interactive experience. The quality and diversity of the generated songs are intertwined with the chosen input, yet the MMM consistently showcases its prowess by delivering coherent and captivating musical outputs.

&nbsp;

## **Desktop Application - Coming Soon**

The full-fledged Algorithmidi desktop application, currently under rigorous development, aims to bring the MMM's potential directly to your workspace. This tool is projected to redefine how music creators ideate, compose, and experiment.

&nbsp;

## **Demo App - A Sneak Peek into Algorithmidi's Magic**

Eager to witness the MMM in action? Algorithmidi's demo version is now in its testing phase. Stay tuned for its anticipated release in Fall 2023, which promises a glimpse into the groundbreaking functionalities the platform offers.

&nbsp;

## **Highlight Reel - Algorithmidi's Symphony of Variations**

Algorithmidi has successfully transformed iconic pieces from Beethoven and Bach to Joplin and DrubecK. Each rendition is a testament to the MMM's adaptability and flair for innovation, whether it's giving a classic tune an electronic twist or introducing a new emotional depth to a contemporary track.

## Example Songs
Standout examples of well-known songs or interesting variational output:

&nbsp;

### Pachabel's Canon

A song everyone should be familiar with helps to highlight how the generator captures the nature of the song.

Diverges and branches just enough to present a different experience in the end.

Also gives a bit of insight into the 'endless' aspect of the song gen, as this example stretches the song to create a 15 minute playthrough with non-repeating fractal variations.

&nbsp;

### Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor

A very distinct organ work and unlikely candidate due to the intricate and complex nature of the song.

Regardless, the generator endlessly weaves various themes and passages of the work back and forth and into a distinct, yet familiar fugal work.

[Generation 1](https://www.bandlab.com/lt_commando/generating-bach-toccata-and-fugue-1-a2bcb7b8?revId=ab1e56c6-ba42-ee11-b8f0-000d3a41ec20)

When fed a piano rendition of the fugue the generator produces another unique variation that is able to fractally loop infinitely (Playback truncated for the web).

&nbsp;

### Bach's Invention Series

Less well known, but quite distinguishable once heard.

The shortness of the songs help make it easy to note the variation in the generated versions.

The shortness also allows for easy observation of the generators 'endless' capabilities.
